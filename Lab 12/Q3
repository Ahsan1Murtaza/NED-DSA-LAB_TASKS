(Standard QuickSort)
Worst on nearly sorted data
Because pivot choice makes extremely unbalanced partitions
Can degrade to O(n²)

(Randomized QuickSort)
Avoids worst-case by randomizing pivot
Usually close to O(n log n)
But still not optimal for nearly sorted data

Merge Sort (especially linked list version)
Always O(n log n)
Independent of data order
Best for linked lists + nearly sorted data
No extra memory for linked lists
